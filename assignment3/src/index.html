      The <b>Bald eagle's</b> The head, neck, and tail of bald eagles are bright, plain white, but
      younger birds may show spotting. Their eyes, bill, legs, and feet are yellow, and their black
      talons are thick and powerful.

      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Although the head of the bald eagle seems to be bald, it is really covered with white
        feathers. Its name really derives from a more ancient word that meant "white-headed." The
        mature bald eagles' "bald" heads stand out vividly against their chocolate brown bodies.
        They have a very broad, thick, yellow bill with a highly hooked upper mandible. The average
        length of the bird is 35 to 42 inches, and its wingspan can reach 7 feet or more.

        Bald eagles pluck fish out of the water with their talons, and sometimes they follow
        seabirds as a means of locating fish. Bald eagles also rob ospreys of their fish. Besides
        live fish, bald eagles also prey on other birds, small mammals, snakes, turtles, and crabs,
        and they readily eat carrion.

      <h2>Breeding</h2>
      <p>
        The whole continental United States and much of Canada are included in the bald eagle's
        range. They may be found in a variety of settings, including the New England deciduous
        woodlands, Californian deserts, and Louisianan bayous. It is the only endemic (native) sea
        eagle in North America. Bald eagles mate from late September to early April, depending on
        the region. The female lays her first egg five to 10 days after mating and incubates the
        eggs for about 35 days. They produce one to three eggs, which is called the clutch size.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bald eagle chicks are born with fluffy white down covering them, but they swiftly grow
        larger and acquire adult feathers. The distinguishing white head and tail of juvenile birds
        do not appear until they are 4 to 5 years old, when they are sexually mature and able to
        mate. Juvenile birds have mottled brown and white plumage.

      Poaching, accidental or intentional shootings, as well as other dangers to raptors including
      pollution, run-ins with wind turbines or power lines, tainted food sources, and habitat
      degradation all pose threats to bald eagles today. A serious concern to bald eagles and other
      big raptors is lead poisoning from fishing lures and used ammunition. `

      <h2>Life span</h2>
      <p>
        Bald Eagles can live a long time. The oldest recorded bird in the wild was at least 38 years
        old when it was hit and killed by a car in New York in 2015. It had been banded in the same
        state in 1977.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bald eagles have an unusually long lifespan compared to other birds. This is because they
        are top predators who don't have to worry about becoming prey to other animals. However, the
        bald eagle's lifespan comes up short compared to other eagles. On average, other well-known
        eagle species, such as the harpy eagle, have been estimated to live anywhere between 25-35
        years in the wild. Now that we've gotten a better understanding of the bald eagle's
        lifespan, let's take a look at how life begins for this magnificent predator.

      <h2>Conservation</h2>
      <p>
        The bald eagle's population is growing, according to the International Union for
        Conservation of Nature, which rates its conservation as being of "least concern." However,
        chemicals, particularly DDT, which was widely used after World War II, had a significant
        negative impact on bald eagle populations. According to the California Department of Fish
        and Wildlife, the once-touted herbicide poisoned bald eagles and caused their eggshells to
        grow thin, leading to several unsuccessful nesting attempts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bald eagle was listed as an endangered species by the federal government in 1967 and by
        California in 1971 due to its declining populations. Strong attempts to recover these birds
        were effective when the use of DDT was outlawed in the United States in 1972, and in 2007
        the bald eagle was taken off the list of endangered species.
